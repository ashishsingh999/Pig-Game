# Pig Game

Pig Game is a multiplayer dice game wherein at the start, Player 1 starts with rolling the dice.

The rules to be the winner are simple and are described below.

#1-
Both players have a current score and a highscore values which are initially, as you can guess are set to 0.

#2-
Upon rolling the dice for the first time and on every subsequent roll dices the value of the roll dice gets added to the initial current score of the active player, which in this case, let's suppose is Player 1.

For example, on rolling the dice for the first time if the dice number is 4, it gets added to the initial current score i,e 0 + 4 = 4. On second roll if the dice is 6, the current score becomes 4 + 6 = 10 and so on.

#3- 
But, there is a catch. The current score of the active user becomes 0 and the chance to roll the dice gets switched to the other Player if the dice roll is 1. So in the case of above example the current score of the Player 1 becomes 0 from 10 and the Player 2 becomes the active player.

#4-
So to prevent the current score from becoming 0, the active player can press the hold button. Pressing the hold button, gets 2 things done. Firstly, it saves the player's current score to the highscore and secondly it switches the active player. For example if Player 1 presses the hold button, then player 2 becomes the active player.

#5-
So, going by the Games logic of rolling the dice and adding the dice value to the current and high scores, whosoever between the 2 Players reaches the highscore of 40 and presses the Hold button becomes Winner of the game. 

#6-
Not to mention getting a 1 on rolling the dice hampers your chances of winning the game. But hey, that's where the fun lies.

Happy Gaming!!ðŸ˜€
